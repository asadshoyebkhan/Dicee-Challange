The repository showcases how JavaScript can be used to manipulate the attributes of HTML tags programmatically. It provides examples and code snippets that illustrate the process of selecting HTML elements, accessing their attributes, and modifying them using JavaScript.
The main focus of this repository is to demonstrate how to set the src attribute of an <img> tag dynamically. It includes sample code that selects specific HTML elements by their class names or ids, and then updates the src attribute with a new value. The examples highlight different approaches such as using getElementById, getElementsByClassName, or querySelector to target specific HTML elements.
